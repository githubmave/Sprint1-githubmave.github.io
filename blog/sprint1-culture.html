    <h1>How to think like a web designer</h1>

        Think about the designed objects you encounter during your day. Reverse engineer their solutions. When you open a magazine and see an advertisement or when you land on a website and take in the aesthetic, really look at what you see. What problem do you think the designer meant to solve?
